features datatype:
	Categorical : Sex, Embarked, Survived
	Ordinal     : Pclass
	Continuous  : Age, Fare
	Discrete    : SibSp, Parch

Missing data:
	train.csv : Age(177), Cabin(687), Embarked(2)
	test.csv  : Age(86), Cabin(327)

Pivot Analysis:
	1. Passengers travelled in Pclass 1 are more likely to survive(62.9%).
	2. Females have survived with the percentage of 74%.
	3. SibSp and Parch have low coreleation value and its better to 
	           	  derive new feature from it(Family=SibSp+Parch).

Visualisation:
	Figure 1: The peoples who travelled in titanic is mostly males and most
		  peoples are from southampton.
	Figure 2: Peoples between the Age 20 - 40 are more likely to survive.
	Figure 3: Passengers who travelled in first class(Pclass=1) have survived and mostly.
		  are ages lie between 20- 40. Passengers travelled in thrid class have the lowest
		  number of survivors between the age 20 -40.
	Figure 4: In Southampton & Queenstown (Embarked =S & Q)females have survived the most and 
		  has travelled in Class 1 & 2 (Pclass =1 & 2) and males are highest survivors in 
		  Cherbourg.
	Figure 5: The fare for the peoples in Southampton and Cherbourg (Embarked = S & C) is high mostly 
		  for females.

Model:
	The Random forest classifier is used with 100 estimators
	The accuracy of model is 89 % 

Data Wrangling:
	1. The features Cabin and Ticket are in no releation with the surivival rate. So, they are eliminated.
	2. The Names in the set is analaysed and corrected and  tittles are mapped according with the categoris
	   ("Mr": 1, "Miss": 2, "Mrs": 3, "Master": 4, "Rare": 5).
	3. Band for countinous datatype is created and set values accordingly.
	4. Created new feature with SibSp and Parch (Family=SibSp+Parch).
	5. Columns that created for setting the band values are removed.

Imputation:
	1. In train_data the missing values are Age= 177 and Embarked= 2.
	2. In test_data the missing values are Age= 86 and Fare= 1.
	3. The imputation are done separately for the train_data and test_data. Sice the Iterative Imputer
	   works only on the dataframe.(Documentation:https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/impute.html).
 	4. Since there are only two missing values in Embarked it is fixed with most occcuring value.
	5. Label Encoding for the categorical features (Sex, Embarked) is done with LabelEnconder.
